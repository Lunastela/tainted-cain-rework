- Minecraft Items randomly disappear sometimes. Attempted a fix for this, but I'll have to wait and see.
- Recipe Book "Alternate" Recipes and combining multiple recipes into one cell. 

Low Priority:
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. SaveManager bug.
- Poops can be collected even when broken. I'm not super motivated to fix this currently.
- Jera & Curse of the Maze. Not on me, I'm waiting for Benny to update SaveManager.
- Recipe Book could be optimized. Currently, the recursive nature causes it to create massive amounts of lag with over 1000 items.
- Crawlspace fix might cause some issues in niche situations. Unsure if this matters, but it's good to note.
