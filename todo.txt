High Priority:
- Recipe Book "Alternate" Recipes and combining multiple recipes into one cell.

Mid Priority:
- Support for Recipes that use an active item's charge instead of consuming the item.
- Swappable Actives with Schoolbag on characters that aren't Tainted Cain.

Low Priority:
- Update SaveManager.
- The bug. You know, the one.
- Fix animations in Item Renderer not consistent with in game animations.
- Support for on the fly Item Tags in Recipes using json arrays in keys.

Notes:
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. SaveManager bug.
- Crawlspace fix might cause some issues in niche situations. Unsure if this matters, but it's good to note.
- Sometimes things don't go into the bag of crafting. Re-entering the room seems to fix this issue.
