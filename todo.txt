High Priority:
- Sorting per all inventories in auto crafting as opposed to per single inventory
- Minecraft Items randomly disappear sometimes. Attempted a fix for this, but it didn't work. Not sure where to start.
- Support for Recipes that use an active item's charge instead of consuming the item
- Recipe Book "Alternate" Recipes and combining multiple recipes into one cell.
- "Salvage/Scrap" variants of items when they're not unlocked that can still be used for crafting items.
- Extended UI Controls (Q to drop in the inventory, number buttons to place items in slots, etc.)

Mid Priority:
- Make "conditional recipe items" display hardcoded attributes like pill color based on effect
- Potentially(?) always reveal pills in recipe conditionals
- Implement keepInventory
- Poops picked up by the bag should not drop anything
- Swappable Actives with Schoolbag on characters that aren't Tainted Cain.

Low Priority:
- The bug. You know, the one.
- Revelations Sand Castles should give Sand
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. SaveManager bug.
- Support for on the fly Item Tags in Recipes using json arrays in keys.
- Potentially restructure Recipe system to use key & value system internally.
- Recipe Book could be optimized. Currently, the recursive nature causes it to create massive amounts of lag with over 1000 items.

Notes:
- Crawlspace fix might cause some issues in niche situations. Unsure if this matters, but it's good to note.
