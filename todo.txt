High Priority:
- Sometimes salvaging doesn't work. Hopefully this has been fixed, but keep an eye out.
- Minecraft Items randomly disappear sometimes. Attempted a fix for this, but it didn't work. Not sure where to start.
- Support for Recipes that use an active item's charge instead of consuming the item
- Recipe Book "Alternate" Recipes and combining multiple recipes into one cell.
- "Salvage/Scrap" variants of items when they're not unlocked that can still be used for crafting items.

Mid Priority:
- Potentially(?) always reveal pills in recipe conditionals
- Swappable Actives with Schoolbag on characters that aren't Tainted Cain.
- Make "conditional recipe items" display hardcoded attributes like pill color based on effect

Low Priority:
- Update SaveManager.
- The bug. You know, the one.
- Fix animations in Item Renderer not consistent with in game animations.
- Support for on the fly Item Tags in Recipes using json arrays in keys.
- Potentially restructure Recipe system to use key & value system internally.

Notes:
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. SaveManager bug.
- Crawlspace fix might cause some issues in niche situations. Unsure if this matters, but it's good to note.
