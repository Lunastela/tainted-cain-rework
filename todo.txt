- Add item tags for: flies, boxes, food
- Make "conditional recipe items" display hardcoded attributes like pill color based on effect
- Potentially(?) always reveal pills in recipe conditionals
- Minecraft Items randomly disappear sometimes. Attempted a fix for this, but it didn't work. Not sure where to start.
- Recipe Book "Alternate" Recipes and combining multiple recipes into one cell.
- Sorting per all inventories in auto crafting as opposed to  
- Add a sprite for categories outside of search category.

Low Priority:
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. SaveManager bug.
- Jera & Curse of the Maze. Not on me, I'm waiting for Benny to update SaveManager.
- Recipe Book could be optimized. Currently, the recursive nature causes it to create massive amounts of lag with over 1000 items.
- Crawlspace fix might cause some issues in niche situations. Unsure if this matters, but it's good to note.
