- Recipes no longer appearing after certain unlocks? Maybe tags not registering recipes correctly?
- Minecraft Items randomly disappear sometimes. This may be related to time in the run somehow? Try % elapsed time.
- Items can still be collected when the inventory is full.
- Jera & Curse of the Maze. Not on me, I'm waiting for Benny to update SaveManager.

Low Priority:
- Sparse arrays sorted when saving. Not a Rework bug, SaveManager bug.
